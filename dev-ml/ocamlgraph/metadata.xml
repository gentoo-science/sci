  It provides an easy-to-use graph data structure together with several
  operations and algorithms over graphs, in Graph.Pack. It is a reasonably
  efficient imperative data structure for directed graphs with vertices
  and edges labeled with integers. Several other graph implementations
  are proposed for those not satisfied with the one above. Some are
  persistent (imutable) and other imperative  (mutable). Some are directed
  and other are not. Some have labels for vertices, or labels for edges,
  or both. Some have abstract types for vertices. etc. These
  implementations are written as functors: you give the types of vertices
  labels, edge labels, etc. and you get the data structure as a result.
  it also provides several classic operations and algorithms over graphs.
  They are also written as functors i.e. independently of the data
  structure for graphs. One consequence is that you can define your own
  data structure for graphs and yet re-use all the algorithms from this
  library: you only need to provide a few operations such as iterating
  over all vertices, over the successors of a vertex, etc.
