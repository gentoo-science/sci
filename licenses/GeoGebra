Guidelines to distinguish Non-commercial and Commercial Use

You may only use the GeoGebra Software and Materials under the terms of a
relevant licence agreement. The licence agreement which applies to you depends
on your use of the Software and the Materials, which can be summarised as
follows:

 * You are free to copy, distribute and transmit GeoGebra for non-commercial
   purposes. Non-commercial use is subject to the terms of our GeoGebra
   Non-Commercial License Agreement.

 * Any use of GeoGebra for a commercial purpose is subject to the licence terms
   set out in our Collaboration and License Agreement Template (pdf). If you
   intend to use GeoGebra for a commercial purpose, please contact
   office@geogebra.org to arrange a Collaboration Agreement with us.

Whether a particular use of the GeoGebra Materials is "non-commercial" depends
on the use, not the user, and to assist we have set out the notes below:

 1. Non-commercial Use. We anticipate that non-commercial use will primarily
    involve students and teachers who may wish to use GeoGebra at home and in
    school for the purposes of their school or academic study and teaching,
    without intending to seek any commercial advantage or financial gain. 

 2. Commercial Use. We anticipate that commercial use will primarily involve
    publishers, online schools, schools or universities charging tuition or
    course fees, and non-profit organizations who wish to use GeoGebra to
    support activities that are intended toward securing a commercial advantage
    or the generation of revenue or monetary compensation. 

Examples of commercial use might include:

 * use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to generate or
   develop educational materials or resources which will be sold in exchange
   for a fee (including course or tuition fees) or (if given away for free)
   which are used to gain a commercial advantage for the user;

 * the provision of training, support or editorial services that use or
   reference GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) in exchange for a
   fee;

 * use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) within an ebook,
   textbook or journal, whether or not the book or journal is distributed for a
   fee; 

 * use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) as part of a
   conference where delegates are charged to attend and/or purchase conference
   materials (which include GeoGebra or any related materials or resources);
   and 

 * use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to assist in
   securing advertising or sponsorship type revenues.
