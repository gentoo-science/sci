*mothur-1.36.1 (30 Nov 2015)

  30 Nov 2015; Martin Mokrejs <mmokrejs@fold.natur.cuni.cz>
  +files/mothur-1.36.1-makefile.patch, +metadata.xml, +mothur-1.36.1.ebuild:
  sci-biology/mothur: version bump; update makefile patch, the other patch from
  1.27 series seems not necessary anymore; added few more IUSE values but the
  makefile could ideally respect them before forcing boost and zlib libraries
  into LIBS
