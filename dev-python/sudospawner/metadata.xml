    Enables JupyterHub to run without being root, by spawning an
    intermediate process via sudo, which takes actions on behalf of the
    user. The sudospawner mediator can only do signal processes via
    os.kill and spawn single-user servers. The only thing the Hub user
    needs sudo access for is launching the sudospawner script itself.
